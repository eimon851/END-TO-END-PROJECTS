# About This Project

  

As a data analyst on the patient research team, my focus is on evaluating the success of the reimbursement program. Iâ€™ll provide insights by answering data-driven questions and offering recommendations to the product and marketing teams. Ultimately, my goal is to help them attract new customers and strengthen brand recognition.

  

## Project Overview

  

### Part A: Claim + Marketing Campaign Analysis (Excel)

- Conduct **claim analysis** to determine **seasonal growth** on various claim metrics, including **product-specific** claim metrics.

- Analyzed **campaign performance** by evaluating **costs, impressions, and sign-up rates** for **customer acquisition**, and **CPC, CPA, and CTR** for customer engagement.

  

### Part B: Specific Insights (SQL)

  

- Delivered comprehensive insights to the Claims department on **top hair-related products**, states with the **highest claims**, most **frequent users** of the reimbursement program, and more.

  

### Part 3: Visualizations (Tableau)

  

- Create interactive dashboards for claim density, campaign reach, and predictive analytics.

  

### Part 4: Recommendations & Next Steps

### MONTH ON MONTH CLAIM GROWTH RATE

#### Claim Numbers

Explain the MOM growth rate of the number of claims in 2023?

- Claim numbers fluctuated throughout 2023, with a decline at the beginning of the year followed by a sharp increase of 22% in March, only to plummet in the later half of the year with July having the sharpest decrease in claim numbers (almost 33%). 
- Based on previous years, it safe to say the claim numbers slightly fluctuate for the remainder of the year. 

#### Claim Amount

- In 2023, the claim amount monthly growth rate was at its highest in March at a 24% increase suggesting that the increase in claim also involved higher cost due to factors like higher claim or more expensive supplements being claimed.
- From March to April we can that the total claim amount only decreased by 4.28%, which is less than the 11.13% decrease in the number of claims suggesting that certain higher-cost supplements were being claimed frequently.
- Lastly, we noticed that from June to July, there's a sharp decline in both claims and claim amount, which can be due to many external factors such as policy changes, reduced demands or seasonality.

  
#### Average Claim Amount

- We can make a hypothesis here that when there is a positive Average Claim Amount Growth (e.g., February, April, June), fewer claims are made, but they are of higher value on average. In months where the average claim amount growth is negative (e.g., May, July), an increase in the number of claims results in lower average claim amounts, indicating that more claims are of lower value.
- There are exceptions. Notably, in March and July, the expected relationship does not hold, suggesting other factors may be influencing the average claim amounts in those months.
