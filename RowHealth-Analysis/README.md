As a data analyst on the patient research team, my focus is on evaluating the success of the reimbursement program.

Ultimately, my goal is to help them attract new customers and strengthen brand recognition.

## MONTH ON MONTH CLAIM GROWTH RATE (2023)

### Claim Numbers and Trends

#### Fluctuations Throughout 2023:

- Claim numbers showed variability during 2023, with a noticeable decline at the start of the year.
- A significant increase of 22% was observed in March.
- The latter half of the year saw a sharp decline, with July experiencing the most substantial decrease in claim numbers (almost 33%).

#### Trends Based on Previous Years:

- Historically, claim numbers tend to fluctuate slightly for the remainder of the year.


### Claim Amount and Impact on Costs

#### Highest Growth in March:

- In March 2023, the claim amount monthly growth rate peaked with a 24% increase, indicating that the increase in claims also involved higher costs, possibly due to higher claim values or more expensive supplements being claimed.

#### March to April Decline:

- From March to April, the total claim amount decreased by only 4.28%, which is less than the 11.13% decrease in the number of claims. This suggests that certain higher-cost 
supplements were claimed more frequently.

#### June to July Decline:

There was a sharp decline in both claims and claim amounts from June to July, potentially due to external factors such as policy changes, reduced demand, or seasonality.

### Average Claim Amount and Its Correlation with Claim Numbers

#### Positive Growth Correlation:

- During months with positive Average Claim Amount Growth (e.g., February, April, June), fewer claims were made, but they were of higher value on average.

#### Negative Growth Correlation:

- In months where the average claim amount growth was negative (e.g., May, July), an increase in the number of claims resulted in lower average claim amounts, indicating that more claims were of lower value.

#### Exceptions:

- March and July did not follow the expected relationship, suggesting other factors might have influenced the average claim amounts in these months.

### CAMPAIGN PERFORMANCE BY CAMPAIGN CATEGORY 

#### #CoverageMatters and Health For All:

- Both campaigns are highlly cost efficient and have sigh sign-up rates making them standout campaigns
- Health For All has the highest sign-up rate (2.08%) and low cost per sign-up ($1.23)

#### Golden Years Security and Benefit Updates
- These campaigns have poor performance with very high cost per sign-up ($176.73 and $47.81, respectifvely) and low sign-up rates (0.01% and 0.02%, respectively)
- Indicates inefficiency in converting impression to sign-ups.

#### Marketing Channels

- Social Media outperforms other channels in terms of the number of sign-ups (7610) and has a relatively low cost per sign-up($2.25)
- Email and SEO also perform well, with reasonable cost per sign-up and significant reach
- TV has the lowest perfoamnce amoung channnels with high cost per sign-up ($10.48) and low sign-up rate (0.08%)

#### Campaign Reach

- Campaigns like Tailored Health Plans and Preventive Care News have high impression but relatively low sign-up rates, indicating a need for better targeting or ad relevance to improve conversion.

### Recommendations

- "Golden Years Security", "Benefit Updates", and the TV channel need improvements due to their high cost per sign-up and low sign-up rates.
- Campaigns with high impressions but low sign-up rates (e.g., "Tailored Health Plans") should focus on improving ad relevance and targeting to convert impressions into sign-ups.
