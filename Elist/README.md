# Portfolio Project - Elist Analysis

Elist, founded in 2018, is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics products, expanding globally and using various marketing channels like email campaigns, SEO, and affiliate links, with popular items from Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad.

In this project, I analyzed a sample dataset to investigate total sales, average order value (AOV), product performance, and operational effectiveness, providing insights on the company's performance across different business areas. I also evaluated the loyalty program's performance and will offer recommendations on key focus areas for the company. To achieve this, I used a combination of various Excel features such as pivot tables, aggregation functions, conditional formatting, and statistical analysis for cleaning, analyzing, and summarizing these insights to be delivered to the finance, marketing, product, and operations teams.

# About the data
