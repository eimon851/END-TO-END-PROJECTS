Using BigQuery, I use SQL to answer these specific questions for our stakeholders...

1. What was the monthly refund rate for purchases made in 2020?
2. How many refunds did we have each month in 2021 for Apple products?
3. Are there certain products that are getting refunded more frequently than others? What are the top 3 most frequently refunded products across all years?
4. What’s the average order value across different account creation methods in the first two months of 2022? Which method had the most new customers in this time?
5. What’s the average time between customer registration and placing an order?
6. Which marketing channels perform the best in each region? Does the top channel differ across regions?
