# Recommendations
- Seasonality: 
	- Focus marketing and promotional efforts heavily during the **holiday season** and **mid-year months** to maximize revenue, while exploring strategies to boost sales during traditionally weaker months like **January** and **February**.
	
- Products: 
	- To boost overall sales performance, prioritize promoting the **27in 4K gaming monitor** and **Apple Airpods Headphones** through targeted marketing campaigns, consider discontinuing the **Bose Soundsport Headphones** due to their poor sales with only **1 unit sold**, and evaluate the **Samsung Charging Cable Pack** and **Samsung Webcam** for potential increased investment, given their strong growth rates of **68%** and **70%**, respectively.

- Loyalty Program
    -   The team recommends **continuing** the loyalty program, as it is **increasingly driving higher average sales** and significantly contributing to overall revenue growth year over year.
    
- Marketing Channels
	- The team recommends **maintaining investments** in the **direct** and **email marketing channels**, as these consistently deliver **robust growth** and **significant sales contributions**. Conversely, it is advised to **reduce marketing efforts** on **social media**, as these channels have accounted for less than 2% of total sales and have shown a further decline in recent years.

- Platform Improvement
	- Our website continues to experience **strong demand** for new **customers/accounts**. We recommend ongoing enhancements to both our **website** and **mobile apps**, as both platforms are consistently seeing **significant growth**.
